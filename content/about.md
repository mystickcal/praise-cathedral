## Who We Are

Praise Cathedral Church of God is a Spirit-filled, Bible-believing church family located at **608 Iowa Avenue in Niles, Ohio**. We've been serving the Trumbull County community since **1996**, and our doors are wide open to anyone looking for a place to grow in faith, find real community, and experience the presence of God.

We're not a perfect church and we don't pretend to be. We're a family of believers doing our best to follow Jesus, love each other, and make a difference right here in our corner of the Mahoning Valley.

## What We Believe

As a **Church of God** congregation, we hold to the core truths of the Christian faith:

- **The Bible** is the inspired Word of God and our guide for life and faith
- **Salvation** through Jesus Christ is available to everyone
- **The Holy Spirit** empowers believers for living and service
- **Water Baptism** and **the Lord's Supper** are observed as ordinances of the church
- **The Second Coming** of Jesus Christ is our blessed hope
- **A life of holiness** is God's desire for every believer

We're part of the [Church of God](https://www.churchofgod.org/) denomination, headquartered in Cleveland, Tennessee.

## Our Heart

We believe the local church should be a place where real people find real hope. That means we welcome you no matter where you've been, what you've done, or what questions you carry. Life is hard enough without feeling judged at the door.

Come as you are. You'll find friendly faces, genuine worship, and a pastor who actually remembers your name.
