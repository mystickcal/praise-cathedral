## What to Expect

**Sunday School** is a time for small-group Bible study with classes for all ages. It's relaxed, conversational, and a great way to dig deeper into Scripture with people who are in your same season of life.

**Morning Worship** is our main service. Expect heartfelt praise and worship, prayer, and a message from Pastor Jim that's grounded in the Word and relevant to everyday life. Services typically run about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.

**Sunday Evening Service** is a more intimate time of worship and teaching. It's a great way to close out the weekend and refocus before the week ahead.

**Wednesday Night** is all about going deeper. Bible study, prayer, and fellowship in a laid-back mid-week setting. Come recharge.
