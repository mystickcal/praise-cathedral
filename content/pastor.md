<h3>A Pastor Who Knows Your Name</h3>

<p>In a world of mega-churches and online services, there's something special about a pastor who knows your name, knows your story, and genuinely cares about what you're going through.</p>

</div>

Pastor Jim Salyers has faithfully served as the shepherd of Praise Cathedral Church of God since the church was established in **1996**. Known to the congregation and community as **Pastor Jim**, he brings a genuine heart for people and a deep love for the Word of God to every service, every conversation, and every prayer.

Alongside him, his wife **Roberta** has been a faithful partner in ministry — supporting the church family, leading by example, and helping make Praise Cathedral the welcoming place it is today.

Pastor Jim isn't the kind of preacher who talks over people's heads. He meets you where you are with a message that's real, practical, and rooted in Scripture. Whether he's preaching on a Sunday morning, visiting someone in the hospital, or just catching up over coffee, his heart for the people of this community comes through in everything he does.

## His Vision

Pastor Jim's vision for Praise Cathedral has always been simple and steadfast:

<div class="info-card">

- **Preach the uncompromised Word of God**
- **Love people right where they are**
- **Build a church that feels like home**
- **Serve the Niles community with open hands**

</div>

Under his leadership, Praise Cathedral has grown into a warm, welcoming place where generations of families have found faith, hope, and belonging.

> *"And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding."* — Jeremiah 3:15
