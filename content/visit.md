## When to Come

<div class="highlight-box">

<h3>🌟 Best First Visit</h3>

<p>Sunday Morning Worship at 11:00 AM — it's our main weekly gathering and gives you the full picture of who we are.</p>

</div>

If you'd rather start with something more low-key, **Wednesday night Bible Study at 7:00 PM** is a smaller, more relaxed setting.

<div class="visit-questions-grid">
  <div class="visit-question">
    <h3>👕 What to Wear</h3>
    <p>Come as you are. Seriously. Some folks dress up, some come in jeans and a T-shirt. We care a lot more about you being here than what you're wearing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="visit-question">
    <h3>👶 What About My Kids?</h3>
    <p>Kids are welcome in all of our services. We have programs and activities for children and youth, and our church family loves kids. Your little ones will feel right at home.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="visit-question">
    <h3>🚫 Will I Be Put on the Spot?</h3>
    <p>Nope. We might acknowledge first-time visitors, but nobody's going to make you stand up, raise your hand, or do anything that makes you uncomfortable. We just want you to feel welcome.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## What Will the Service Be Like?

Our Sunday morning worship typically includes:

- **Praise and worship** — Expect heartfelt, Spirit-filled music
- **Prayer** — We believe in the power of prayer and make time for it
- **The message** — Pastor Jim preaches from the Bible in a way that connects to real life
- **Fellowship** — Stick around after service. People will want to meet you

The whole thing runs about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.
